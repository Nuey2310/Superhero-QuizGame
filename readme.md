Features Implemented and Values learned:

- Dhairy Raval
	* Implemented the database and made the db.php file to connect it with the rest of the game
	* Made a Modal to display the instructions to play the game 

	I learned the importance of communication in group projects like this one. Also, this project reminded me that in a group project different people have different views and ideas, the best way to move forward is to adjust and adapt.

- Neuer Gao
    * Refactored the database based on what Dhairy do, made the database structure better for back-end development and made the improved the db.php file. 
	* Get the information from the database, display them on 3 websites (marvel.php; dc.php, starWars.php), made the html elements generated dynamically by php. 
	* Fixed some error before we submit and host this website.
