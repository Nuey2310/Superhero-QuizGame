Features Implemented and Values learned:

- Dhairy Raval
	* Implemented the database and made the db.php file to connect it with the rest of the game
	* Made a Modal to display the instructions to play the game 

	I learned the importance of communication in group projects like this one. Also, this project reminded me that in a group project different people have different views and ideas, the best way to move forward is to adjust and adapt.
